This is a project for the Nand2tetris part -2 course in Coursera. (Course Link - https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer )

Here, I built a assembler for their hack computer using java.

It converts their Hack assembly language code (like of NASM, FASM) to binary form (like a binary file, .exe).

Translator is to be run in command line.

Code is bit messy but it works.
